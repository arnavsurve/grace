Grace is a compiler, runtime model, and systems programming language for creating
COBOL-based services that bridge mainframes with the modern world. It lets you write
high-level code that interacts with fixed-width files, VSAM records, CSVs, JSON, SQL,
and cloud services. All from one coherent system.

Designed for simplicity, structure, and self-evident programs, Grace brings a modern
developer experience to legacy systems.

> Code is art, and mainframes deserve poetry.
