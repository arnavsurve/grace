> Grace is a compiler, runtime model, and DSL for creating COBOL-based services that can  
> operate in ecosystems where CSV, JSON, SQL, and cloud protocols are first-class citizens.  
> Itâ€™s designed for simplicity, structure, and self-evident programs, with an emphasis on  
> providing a modern developer experience.

> Code is art, and mainframes deserve poetry.
