Grace is a compiler, runtime model, and systems programming language for writing
COBOL-based services that bridge mainframes with the modern world.

It compiles to modern, readable COBOL, allowing you to write high-level, functional
programs that interact with fixed-width files, VSAM records, CSVs, JSON, SQL, and cloud
services.

Designed for simplicity, structure, and self-evident programs, Grace brings a
modern developer experience to legacy systems.


## Language Specification

See [docs/grammar.lark](docs/grammar.lark) for the official EBNF grammar of Grace, and
